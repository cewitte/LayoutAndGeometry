# Layout and Geometry

## Paul Hudson's ([@twostraws](https://x.com/twostraws)) 100 Days of Swift UI Project 18

Source URL: [Layout and geometry: Introduction](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/layout-and-geometry-introduction)

>In this technique project we’re going to explore how SwiftUI handles layout. Along the way you’ll also learn about creating more advanced layout alignments, building special effects using `GeometryReader`, and more – some real power features that I know you’ll be keen to deploy in your own apps.

_Note: In this project, I chose to go with less branches and a shorter Read Me, focusing only on what I've found interesting or important for my own projects. One can always refer to Paul's original tutorial (always recommended) for a complete explanation._
